# Index Implementation using B-Trees in RDBMS

- B-Tree based indexing speeds up searching in a relational database which reduces the search time by a factor of LogN
  where N is the degree of the tree.

- By using indices, overall performance also improves, thereby decreasing the number
  of disk reads.
